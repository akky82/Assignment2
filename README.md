Welcome to Django Weather Services project.

This project is written in python and uses the django framework.

The requirements for the project can be found in requirements.txt

This project contains two apps, the first is weather_app, which takes the input of longitude and latitude co-ordinates and returns information pertaining to the current weather, min/max temperature for the day and the name of the location that corresponds to the co-ordinates.

The second app is a chat bot, which you ask questions about a particular part of the weather, eg temperature, humidity and give the chat bot a city or set of co-ordinates also. You can also just try saying Hello.

Unit requirements asked for basic HTML/CSS only, as the previous unit only taught HTML/CSS and then moved to Java, rather than continue the front-end progression of Javascript. As such, minimal JS has been used in this project.
